# TwitterPilot Web App

This web app is made to solve the problem of user on Twitter for automatic following accounts, unfollowing accounts and deleting tweets automatically between a period of time frame.

This idea comes as a result of Twitters Users finding it difficult grow their followers (audiences) on the platform. To perform all of these manually can be so overwhelming and our app has come with the solutions to this challenge.

This project is our team final project for specialization during ALX Software Engineering Program, hence, it is still under development and will keep improving over time.
